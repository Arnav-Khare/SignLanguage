#                       Combining Opposites : Taking Deaf into conversation.

American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language of the deaf community in North America(but not limited to those borders). It uses a combination of hand movements, facial expressions, and body posture.

The Alphabet in sign language is the starting point for anyone who wants to communicate with a Deaf person.
There are more we can do with these sign language.
We can communicate underwater/space/through glass/in noisy place(where we can’t speak/communicating)

Using the alphabet in sign language is also called finger/Hand  spelling. It is commonly used in a few different situations, such as:                                                                                                   
*Spelling out a person's name, before you get to know their personalized 'name sign'.                                  
*Spelling out a place name or location before you get to know its designated sign.

# Why this :
When communicating with a Deaf person from another region (dialects and signs can be different, so being able to fingerspell is a great back-up)

ASL is a common sign language – though by far not the only one – for people who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing (deaf refers to the physical condition of deafness, while Deaf refers to belonging to the Deaf community). .
ASL “entails five parameters: handshapes, palm orientation, location (space on the body, around the signer), movement and of course, facial expressions”

Fact : About 15% of adults in America report hearing loss, and about 1 million use sign language to communicate.

# Justifying the topic relation to theme :
we have got theme “connecting opposites “ so in this theam we came up
with idea to that we can make a project where we can initiate a helping hand to deaf .
Don’t think it's only useful to deaf but this project  could also be used by normal people who want to communicate with deafs or can try it where we can’t talk.

#               Its just like we are giving them a “virtual ear” to communicate.
